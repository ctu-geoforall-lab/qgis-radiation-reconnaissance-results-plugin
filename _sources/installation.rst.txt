Installation
************

Among many ways to install the plugin the easiest one is to install it from 
the QGIS plugin repository.

1) From ``Plugins`` drop down menu select ``Manage and Install Plugins...``.

   Open plugins dialog.

2) Go to ``Settings`` tab and press ``Add...`` button. Write
http://geo.fsv.cvut.cz/geoforall/qgis-plugins.xml to ``URL`` and press ``OK``. 
This way you add a path to plugin's home repository CTU GeoForAll Lab because 
right now the plugin is not registered in the official QGIS repository. At 
this time plugin is distributed as experimental so if you want to see it you 
have to tick the checkbox ``Show also experimental plugins``.

   Add home plugin's repository.
          
3) Go to ``All`` or ``Not installed`` tab and search for ``Radiation 
Reconnaissance Results``. Select it and press ``Install plugin`` button.

The Radiation Reconnaissance Results's icon is now shown in the QGIS Plugins 
Toolbar and plugin is ready to use.
